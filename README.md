# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. Based on the Cleveland dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we employ various Python-based data science libraries to create a model that can accurately predict heart disease based on a set of clinical parameters.

## Features
- Data exploration and preprocessing of the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.
- Analysis of different features' impact on heart disease.
- Implementation of Logistic Regression model for prediction with a mean cross-validation score of 0.845.
- Evaluation of model performance and further recommendations for improvement.
